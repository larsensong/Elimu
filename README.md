# Elimu-E-Learner


Elimu e-learner is an online based platform  inspired by online learning platforms such as Kimba and  ALX's intranet.Users such as mentors can review and check students' code. Students register and add their email and password for registration. They then add their Github account  link on which the projects to be reviewed will be saved.

  
      Technologies employed:
   
   MySql, SqlAlchemy, Python,Bootstrap, Javascript,Bootstrap and Nginx...
   
     Challenge

  Getting started:
Elimu e-learner provides a platform for rechecking work done by students or junior employees (software developers). The code review based platform allows users to register using a unique email and password for account creation.

    Features:
Registered users are required to provide a link to the github account where the project is done.The mentor will then be able to navigate to the project that was submitted by the student and then run a checker on it.

The checker is then supposed to provide a score and this grading is employed based on Pycodestyle,File permissions, Shebang, Emptyline and the correct output of the code written..
   
 The main challenge is the platform will only be able to review python based projects.As at now the platform will only run on a local machine. But its still under development to be web based.


          Risks
Elimu e-learner will have a major impact on e learner based platform since it will not only facilitate grading but at the same time allow its users to be able to easily find errors and issues that do not follow the rules set when carrying out projects..
   

              Existing Platform

The existing ALX intranet and Kimba are efficient, Elimu e learner provides a platform not only for learners but it can still be employed within an organization or institution for reviewing work and enhancing growth..

               API $ Methods
                  
Although the home page of the website is HTML, the online platform for Elimu will be written in Python.
I'll use it in conjunction with the Flask API to build the website. 
Because my notion is portable, customizable, and lightweight, it is more feasible to use the Flask API. Some of the methods employed are:

/api/user/<id>: 
GET: Returns information about the registered user(username,, github link, email )
  
/api/<user>/project: 
GET: returns a list of all projects submitted by the user
